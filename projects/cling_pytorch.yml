shortdescription: Interfacing Cling and PyTorch together to facilitate\
  Machine Learning workflows
description: |
  Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of Clang
  and LLVM compiler infrastructure. Cling realizes the read-eval-print
  loop (REPL) concept, in order to leverage rapid application
  development. Implemented as a small extension to LLVM and Clang,
  the interpreter reuses its strengths such as the praised concise and
  expressive compiler diagnostics. The LLVM-based C++ interpreter has
  enabled interactive C++ coding environments, whether in a standalone shell
  or a Jupyter notebook environment in xeus-cling.

  In this project we aim to demonstrate that interactive C++ is useful
  with data analysis tools outside of the field of HEP. For example,
  prototype implementations for Pytorch have been successfully completed.

  The project deliverables are:
    * Demonstrate that we can build and use PyTorch programs with\
    Cling in Jupyter notebook.
    * Develop several non-trivial ML tutorials using interactive C++\
    in Jupyter
    * Experiment with automatic differentiation via Clad of PyTorch codes
  Candidate requirements:
    * Experience with C++, Jupyter notebooks and Conda are desirable
    * Experience with ML Interest in exploring the intersection of data\
    science and interactive C++.
