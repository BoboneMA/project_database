shortdescription: Integrate SONIC with End-to-End (E2E) deep learning inference engine within CMSSW.
description: >
  Deep learning techniques have been proven to provide excellent performance for a variety of high-energy physics applications, including particle identification, event reconstruction, and trigger operations. The end-to-end (E2E) deep learning project combines deep learning algorithms with low-level detector representation. This project will focus on the integration of deep learning frameworks with the CMSSW inference engine using Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors (SONIC).  SONIC provides simplified support for CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs in real-time trigger operations and offline production.
